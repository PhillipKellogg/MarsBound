        <p>I am an aspiring Fullstack developer and video game enthusiast. I first got into programming through making games in Unity, using C# and unities libraries. This 
            was a fantastic learning experience for me and opened my horizon to the joys of programming. Personally its a field I love as each problem is presented like 
            an intricate puzzle that although at times can be frustrating, is immensely gratifying to solve!
        </p>
        <p>My passion for programming extends far being games however, as I have studied and received a Diploma from BrainStations web development program along with worked on many other 
            react websites on my own and as a member of dev team.
